# Telco-Customer-Churn-Analysis
Customer churn analysis is the process of identifying and understanding the reasons why customers stop using a company's products or services, known as "churning." This analysis is crucial for businesses because retaining existing customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.

## Introduction

Customer churn is a critical issue for telecom companies. This project aims to understand the reasons behind churn and develop a predictive model to identify at-risk customers.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Telco Customer Churn dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn). It includes information about customers' demographics, account information, and services they use.

## Data Preprocessing

Steps taken to clean and prepare the data for analysis:
- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical variables
- Normalizing numerical features

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Key insights from the data:
- Distribution of churn across different demographics
- Correlation between features and churn
- Visualizations of key features

## Modeling

Machine learning models used:
- Logistic Regression
